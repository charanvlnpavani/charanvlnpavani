# Namaste üôè, I'm [Pavani VLN Charan]!

## About Me
I'm a passionate Frontend Developer with over 2 years of experience specializing in React.js, JavaScript, and modern web technologies. My journey in web development began with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, and has since evolved into a focused expertise in frontend technologies, user-centered design, and creating engaging, responsive web applications.

In my current and past roles, I have:

Developed and optimized role-based authentication systems for government-backed school management projects, ensuring robust data security and streamlined access control.
Engineered scalable B2B SaaS platforms and applications that reduced operational costs and improved user interactions.
Created interactive dashboards and ticket management features for telecom platforms, enhancing server monitoring capabilities and reducing issue resolution times.
My experience spans working with tools such as Git, REST APIs, Bootstrap, AJAX, JSON, and I am proficient with version control systems (SVN, GitHub) and Linux commands for deployment and server-side management. I thrive in collaborative environments and have consistently delivered solutions that improve user engagement and operational efficiency.
